 What's the best way to destroy the Sun? Could a cosmic fire to part and spray water all over it and put it out? Well, kind of. But the problem is the Sun is not a fire, it's not burning. The Sun shines not because of combustion, but because, well, it's so big. The immense gravitational force caused by its mass is powerful enough to fuse atoms together in the core. This causes them to release energy. Sunlight, adding water to the Sun would only make it more massive, increasing the gravitational pressure that causes fusion. So instead of fizzling out, it would burn brighter. But the brighter it burns, the faster it runs out of fuel. As I pointed out 12 years ago, 20 solar masses of water added to the Sun would shrink its expected remaining lifetime from 5 billion years to only a few hundred million. But if you can't wait that long, I suggest something more sinister than water. Water! If you sprayed the Sun so powerfully that its matter was scattered across space, it would no longer have the critical density needed for fusion to occur. It would be snuffed out, but only for so long. Just like Alex Mack or the T1000, a scattered Sun can reconstitute itself slowly over time under its own gravity. It can recalapse. The only way to make sure that doesn't happen is to spread its guts widely enough, beyond what's known as the Gene's Length. The Gene's Length is a critical radius at which a cloud of gas and dust's thermal energy, the motion of its molecules which causes it to expand, can no longer counteract the effects of gravity bringing it together, and it collapses. Our Sun's Gene's Length is Astronomical. Literally, it's at least 10,000 Astronomical Units. That's 250 times wider than our solar system. That's a big mess. A big, dark, cold mess.
